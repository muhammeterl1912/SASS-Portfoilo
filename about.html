        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Muhammet, a full-stack web developer studying
          Computer Engineering at Vistula University in Poland, set to graduate
          on March 31, 2024. My journey into web development began with a
          curiosity for the digital world. Through my studies, I've mastered
          front-end and back-end development, crafting dynamic web experiences.
          I thrive on challenges, from building responsive interfaces with
          React, CSS, and JavaScript to architecting robust back-end systems
          with Node.js and Express. As I approach graduation, I'm eager to
          translate my passion for technology into a fulfilling career. Let's
          connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!

          <h3>Computer and Introduction to Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I began my journey in Computer Engineering in Poland during that
            year 2020 and 2022, where I immersed myself in introductory
            programming and essential computer concepts. Through dedicated
            study, I acquired a solid foundation in coding languages and
            fundamental computer principles. With a passion for innovation and
            problem-solving, I'm committed to furthering my skills and making
            meaningful contributions to the field of technology.

            From 2019 to 2020, I immersed myself in language courses, determined
            to master English. With each lesson, I delved deeper into grammar,
            expanded my vocabulary, and refined my communication skills. It
            wasn't without challenges, but with perseverance, I overcame them,
            fueled by my passion for learning. Reflecting on this journey fills
            me with pride. It's not just about language; it's about personal
            growth and seizing opportunities.
